# Webpack Configs

Various slightly opinionated shared webpack configurations to help you survive.
Particularly useful with tools like [webpack-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge).

## Why?

1. Specifically for my lazy self use case to not repeat common config over and over again.
2. Maybe for you who have similarly use case as mine.
